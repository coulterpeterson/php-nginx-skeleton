## PHP-NGiÐ˜X-Skeleton
Basic skeleton for Docker Compose that runs nginx and PHP7.

------

Code written following the [fantastic guide](http://geekyplatypus.com/dockerise-your-php-application-with-nginx-and-php7-fpm) by mikechernev. It will serve as the basis for more complex development environments I use. 

You can find Mike's repo at https://github.com/mikechernev/dockerised-php.

_Note: Later applied some of the suggested modifications made by Mike in his [revised article](http://geekyplatypus.com/making-your-dockerised-php-application-even-better/), mostly to generalize the index file and enable logging for the php-fpm Docker image._
